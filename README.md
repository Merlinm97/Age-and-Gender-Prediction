Age and Gender Prediction Project 

Developed an age and gender prediction system utilizing MTCNN for accurate face detection and Caffe-based deep learning models (age_net and gender_net) for classification. 
OpenCV was used for preprocessing and model inference, including image resizing and mean subtraction for improved predictions. 
The model was tested on 45+ images, achieving over 90% accuracy in predicting both age and gender. 
This project highlights expertise in computer vision, deep learning, and model optimization for real-world applications.
